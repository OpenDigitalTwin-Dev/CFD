This example simulates steady natural convection in a concentric annulus. The boundary conditions on the cylinders are imposed through the flux-based volume penalization method. The flux-forcing function is constructed numerically. Please refer Section 5.7 of "Thirumalaisamy, R., Patankar, N.A. and Bhalla, A.P.S., 2022, Handling Neumann and Robin boundary conditions in a fictitious domain volume penalization framework, Journal of Computational Physics, 448, p.110726" for more details on this example.

The current example writes the temperature along the left half of the cylinder and the polar angle in binary format. Please use "read_write_ascii.cpp" code to get the temperature and polar angle in ascii format in the temperature_profile folder.
